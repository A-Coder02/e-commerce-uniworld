## Project Overview

This project is part of a FullStack Developer Technical Task to design a web application for an online store that sells mobile phones and manages products. The app includes:

- User Sign Up (Email, Password, Role: Admin or Customer)
- User Login and Logout
- Role-based Home Pages:
  - Customers can view all products.
  - Admins can manage products they have created (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
  - Both Customer & Admin can create order
- Public product viewing without authentication.
- Admin-only product management functionality.
- Backend API integration with JWT-based authentication.
- Local database assumed PostgreSQL with RESTful API endpoints.

---

## Features

- User Authentication (Sign Up, Login, Logout) with role-based access
- Role-based UI for Customers and Admins
- Product listing with card layout and detailed view
- Admins can Create, Update, Delete their products
- Form validation with Formik and Yup
- Infinite scrolling on product list for performance
- Toast notifications for feedback
- JWT token management with role decoding
- Mobile-friendly web design (desktop-focused, no dedicated mobile app)
- Unit testing for components and API calls

---

## Tech Stack & Tools

### Frontend

- React 19
- Redux Toolkit + React-Redux
- React Router DOM for routing
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Formik + Yup for forms and validation

- Jest & React Testing Library for testing
- Vite for fast dev server and bundling

### Backend

- Node.js with Express framework
- PostgreSQL relational database for data storage
- JWT-based authentication and role-based authorization
- RESTful API design following best practices
- Swagger for API documentation and testing
- Nodemon for automatic server restarts during development
- Jest and Supertest for unit and integration testing
- Environment variable management with dotenv
- CORS middleware for cross-origin resource sharing
- Password hashing with bcryptjs

## Notes

- The frontend communicates with a backend API for authentication and product management.
- Authentication state is managed using JWT tokens stored in `sessionStorage`.
- Only users with the role **"admin"** can create, update, or delete products.
- Customers can browse products without authentication.
- Toast notifications inform users of success and error messages.
- The UI adapts based on user roles (admin vs customer).
- Form validation and error handling are done with Formik and Yup.
- Infinite scroll improves product list performance and user experience.
- React Router DOM manages routing and navigation.
- Tailwind CSS is used for rapid styling and responsiveness.
